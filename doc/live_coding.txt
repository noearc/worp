= Live coding

Worp has been designed to allow live editing of the code without interrupting
sound playback. New chunks of Lua code can be sent to worp trough a local
network socket, and are compiled and executed on the fly. A proof-of-concept
vim plugin is available which can send parts of the current file to a running
worp process.

Load the plugin with the vim command

:luafile ~/sandbox/prjs/worp/vimplugin.lua<CR>

The plugin currently remaps the following vim key sequences:

* ,a : send the whole file to worp
* ,f : send the current function
* ,p : send the current paragraph
* ,<CR> : send the current line


Be careful with locals when using live coding: any functions or variables
defined local during chunk loading will not be available when loading the next
chunk. All code is loaded into the same environment, so use globals instead.

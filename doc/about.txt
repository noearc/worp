== Dependencies

Worp has the following dependencies:

* LuaJIT >= 2.0.0
* Fluidsynth (optional)
* LGI (optional)
* Linuxsampler (optional)


== Misc

During the development of Worp I learned of the existence of Impromptu and
SuperCollider, which both have features similar to worp (Event scheduling, live
coding, etc). I've shamelessly stolen some ideas here and there from both
projects where I saw fit.

* [http://impromptu.moso.com.au]
* [http://supercollider.sourceforge.net]

This would probably be a good place to write about the likes and the
differences between these systems and Worp, but I feel I don't know enough
about either to be able to write anything useful here.

= Introduction

Worp is an experimental sound / music / DSP engine written in LuaJIT, currently
in early alpha state.

Some highlights:

== Bindings for Jack, Linuxsampler, Fluidsynth:

Worp comes with default bindings for Jack audio and midi, and has built-in
support for Linuxsampler and Fluidsynth.

== Built on LuaJIT:

Worp is built on LuaJIT, a Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) for the Lua
programming language. LuaJIT gives the flexibility and robustness of a
proven language, while delivering near native performance. This allows for
low-level DSP code (filters, reverbs, etc.) to be written in a high level
language.

== Live coding:

Worp supports live coding through the use of a plug-in for your favourite
editor (if your favourite editor is Vim). Code is sent from the editor into
the Worp process, where it is compiled and executed without disrupting the
current program flow.

Worp is in early development and subject to lots of changes. Expect
documentation to be outdated, examples to fail and API's to be different then
described.

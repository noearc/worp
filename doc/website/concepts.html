<h1>Basic concepts</h1>

<p> Worp is built on the following core concepts:



<h2>The sandbox</h2>

<p> Worp scripts are run in a Lua sandbox. This is simple a separate namespace in
the Lua interpreter where code can be loaded without interfering with Worp
itself.

<p> Any variables and functions which are not defined local will end up being
globals in the sandbox namespace. While globals are usually considered bad
practice, they come in handy when using live programming: when new chunks are
sent from the editor to Worp they are run in the same sandbox and can access or
alter any defined variables.



<h2>Instruments</h2> 

<p> An instrument in Worp is basically a function which, when called, will
start generating sound at the given note and given volume.  Calling the same
function more than once will play more then one note for polyphonic
instruments, and calling the same function for an active note with the volume
set to zero will mute the note.

<p>Worp uses midi note numbers for instruments, where 60 is defined as the
middle C at 261.6 Hz. Volume is given in the range 0 to 1.

<p>For example, the following code will play the middle C on piano for 1 second at
medium volume (assuming the function 'piano' has been defined earlier):

<div class=code>
piano(60, 0.8)
at(1, function() 
   piano(60, 0) 
end)
</div>

<p>Because Worp is all about playing notes, the 'play()' function is provided
as a shorthand. Again playing the middle C for one second:

<div class=code>
play(piano, 0.8, 1)
</div>



<h2>Time</h2> 

<p> Time in Worp is handled by the event scheduler, which does nothing more
than calling functions at a requested time. To schedule a function for future
execution, use the built in function 'at':

<div class=code> 
at(TIME, FUNCTION [, ...])
</div>

<p> For example, the following line will print the text "Hello world" after one
second:

<div class=code> 
at(1, function() 
   print("Hello", "world") 
end)
</div>

<p> The 'at()' function has a shorthand notation for functions which are defined
globally:

<div class=code> 
at(1, "print", "Hello", "world")
</div>

<p>Worp takes care not to let time slip unexpectedly. Consider the following fragment:

<div class=code> 
at(1, 'play', piano, 60, 0.3)
at(1, 'play', piano, 72, 0.3)
</div>

<p> If at() would use the current time as reference for scheduling function calls
in the future, there would be no guarantee that the two notes would be played
at the same time: if any time goes by between the two calls to 'at()', the
two calls will be scheduled to run at a different time.

<p> Instead, at() uses another time reference: <i>the time the current function
was scheduled to run,</i> even if for some reason the current function was
scheduled too early or too late.

<p> The result is that the following code:

<div class=code>
function tick()
   print("tick")
   at(1, tick)
end   
tick()
</div>

<p> is sure to call the tick() function at exact 1 second intervals on average,
without introducing additional delay caused by the time needed to run the code.





<p> On top of this function more complex objects such as metronomes and pattern
generators can be built.


<h2>Jack</h2>

<p>Worp has been designed to be Jack-centric. Jack provides a lot of usable
plumbing, which is readily available from Worp.

<ul>

	<li>Connecting ports: Worp can be used to drive external samplers, synths
	and effects, which all have Jack audio ports. Worp can manage all audio and
	midi ports, making and breaking connections on the fly.

	<li>Sound: Worp uses jack to send and receive audio. Using the performance
	of the LuaJIT compiler, a lot of DSP can be done to build synthesizers and
	effects.
	
	<li>Midi: Jack is used to send and receive MIDI messages to other
	applications and/or devices.
</ul>

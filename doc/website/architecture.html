<h1>Architecture</h1>

<p> Worp is written mostly in Lua (except for some C code for binding to the OS
and Jack), and is run using LuaJIT. LuaJIT is an alternate implementation of
the Lua language that is highly optimized and can deliver near native
performance for numeric applications, which comes in handy for generating sound
and doing digital signal processing.

<h2> Running code </h2>

<p> At startup, Worp creates a Lua sandbox and is ready to receive Lua code to
process. Any scripts to run at startup can be passed on the command line, or
chunks of Lua code can be sent over a local TCP socket to the Worp process. The
network connection is used by a Vim plug-in to sent blocks or lines of code
directly from the editor to Worp, which will compile and run the code without
disrupting running audio.

<h2> Loading libraries </h2>

<p>When worp encounters a reference to an undefined variable in the sandbox, it
will check if a library is available which will provide this symbol, and load
it on the fly.

<p>The current method looks for a file with the given name in the ./lib directory,
load the chunk and use the return value of the chunk.

<b>Worp</b> is an experimental sound / music / DSP engine written in LuaJIT, currently
in early alpha state.

<p>
Some highlights:

<ul>

	<li>Bindings for Jack, Linuxsampler, Fluidsynth:
	<p>
	Worp comes with default bindings for 
	<a href="http://jackaudio.org/">Jack</a> 
	audio and midi, and has built-in support for 
	<a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/">Linuxsampler</a> and 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fluidsynth/">Fluidsynth</a>.

	<li>
	Built on LuaJIT: 
	<p>
	Worp is built on 
	<a href="http://luajit.org/luajit.html">LuaJIT</a>, 
	a Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) for the 
	<a href="http://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a>
	programming language. LuaJIT gives the flexibility and robustness of a
	proven language, while delivering near native performance. This allows
	for low-level DSP code (filters, reverbs, etc.) to be written in a high
	level language.

	<li>
	Live coding:
	<p>
	Worp supports live coding through the use of a plug-in for your favourite
	editor (if your favourite editor is Vim). Code is sent from the editor into
	the Worp process, where it is compiled and executed without disrupting the current
	program flow.
</ul>

Worp is in early development and subject to lots of changes. Expect
documentation to be outdated, examples to fail and API's to be different then
described.

= GUI

Support for a graphical user interface is under development. The Gui library
creates a window where controls and modules can be added.

== Example

For example, the following fragment:

  gui = Gui:new()
  f = Dsp:Filter()
  gui:add_mod(f)

will generate this user interface window, mapping each control of the module to
a suitable graphical representation:

Turning the knobs will adjust the control values, and any changes in the controls
will reflect in the knob positions.

NOTE: The current code does not handle fast control updates well, so use with care.


== Implementation

The Gui is generated using Gtk through the LGI library:

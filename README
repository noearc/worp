Worp is an experimental sound / music / DSP engine written in LuaJIT, currently
in early alpha state.

Some highlights:

- Built on LuaJIT: the ease of using a high level language, but getting near
  native C performance. Even low-level DSP functions (filters, reverb) can be
  coded in Lua, still giving great performance.

- Live coding: add or update code while the application is running through the
  use of a vim plugin. New chunks can be sent and compiled on the fly.

- Bindings for Fluidsynth and midi support


Building 
========

Worp depends on the following packages:

- luajit (>= 2.0.0)
- Jack audio connection kit
- Fluidsynth

For live programming you need vim with built in lua support.

Worp currently has no proper build system, just some static makefiles. Build
by running 'make', and run from the current directory:

  $ make
  $ ./worp [script]

The prjs/ directory contains some example scripts, which can be passed on the
commandline to run at startup:

  $ ./worp prjs/scales.lua

Worp is an experimental sound / music / DSP engine written in LuaJIT, currently
in early alpha state.

Some highlights:

- Built on LuaJIT: the ease of using a high level language, but getting near
  native C performance. Even low-level DSP functions (filters, reverb) can be
  coded in Lua, still giving great performance.

- Live coding: add or update code while the application is running through the
  use of a vim plugin. New chunks can be sent and compiled on the fly.

- Bindings for Fluidsynth and midi support


Dependencies:

- luajit 2.0.0
- luaposix
- Jack audio connection kit
- Fluidsynth


During the development of worp I learned of the existence of Impromptu
(http://impromptu.moso.com.au/), which shares some of the basic design
principles with Worp (delayed recursion, live coding). I later shamelessly
stole some more ideas, mostly from the pitch class library which is used for
working with scales and chords.

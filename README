Worp is an experimental sound / music / DSP engine written in LuaJIT, currently
in early alpha state.

The main Worp web site and documentation can be found at http://worp.zevv.nl

== Some highlights:

- Built on LuaJIT: the ease of using a high level language, but getting near
  native C performance. Even low-level DSP functions (filters, reverb) can be
  coded in Lua, still giving great performance.

- Live coding: add or update code while the application is running through the
  use of a vim plugin. New chunks can be sent and compiled on the fly.

- Bindings for Fluidsynth and midi support
